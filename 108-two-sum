/*
Step 1: Use a Map<Integer, Integer> to store the number as the key and its index as the value.
Step 2: For each number in the list, calculate the complement (target - current number).
Step 3: Check if the complement exists in the Map. If it does, the two numbers that add up to the target have been found, so return their indices.
Step 4: If the complement is not found, add the current number and its index to the Map and continue.
